### What case is being solved?
Write a program that can guess the number with minimum tries.

**Competition conditions:**
- Computer makes an integer in range from 0 to 100 and our task is to guess it. "Guess" here means "write a program that guesses the number".
- The algorithm takes into account the information about a random number being higher or lesser than required.

**Quality measures**
Results are graded by average number of tries within 1000 repeats.

**What is being practiced**
Learning to write fine code on python.
